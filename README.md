## 1.-  How to configure authentication, obtaining a session and chosing grant types in V8 api suitecrm.

<h3>There are two types of grant:</h3>

Firstly for any of the two grants, you must go into the admin panel of the suitecrm instance and search for `OAuth2 Clients and Tokens`. After that in the top-left corner you must see the following types of grants/clients.

The difference between them are that the first one is focused on letting acces into crm for machines or services, whilist the other is more focused on letting users acces the application.

## 2.- How to configure the user to only have permissions to create (create + check if it is easier for you) only objects from the accounts module.

<h3> Steps to follow in order to limit a user to only create accounts: </h3>

1. As an admin, create the user that will have the accounts limitation.

3. In the following screens after the creation of the role, you will have to select that every option to be "Disabled" or "None", except for the Access option in the Accounts, which should be "Enabled" module and the Edit option in the same module, which should be "All".

5. If needed, you can create a security group that has said role assigned to it.

## 3.- Api requirements.

In order to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, the authorization server MUST require the use of TLS with server authentication as defined by RFC2818 for any request sent to the authorization and token endpoints. The client MUST validate the authorization serverâ€™s TLS certificate as defined by RFC6125 and in accordance with its requirements for server identity authentication.

SuiteCRM uses key cryptography in order to encrypt and decrypt, as well as verify the integrity of signatures.

<b>Please ensure that you have the following:</b>

   1. OpenSSL PHP Extension installed and configured

   2. The SuiteCRM instance must be configured to use HTTPS/SSL

   3. You need to have PHP version 5.5.9, or 7.0 and above
   
Also you need to install composer packages:
    
`composer install`
    
Then you need to create keys:

Edit `Api/Core/ApiConfig.php/` and find `const OAUTH2_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and update its value using a `base64_encode(random_bytes(32))`.
